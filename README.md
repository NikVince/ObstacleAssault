# Obstacle Assault

## My Learning Journey

This project represents my initial steps into game development with C++ in Unreal Engine 5. I created this obstacle course to learn fundamental concepts of game programming while building something playable and fun.

## What I Learned

Through this project, I gained hands-on experience with C++ in UE5, focusing on creating dynamic level elements. I learned how to make platforms move and obstacles rotate by writing custom C++ classes, exposing variables to the editor, and implementing movement logic with vector mathematics.

The most valuable skill I developed was understanding how code translates to in-game behavior - seeing my first lines of C++ bring objects to life in the game world was incredibly satisfying.

## Project Setup

To run this project you'll need Unreal Engine 5 and Visual Studio with C++ tools installed. Clone the repository, generate the Visual Studio project files by right-clicking the .uproject file, and build the solution before opening in UE5.

## The Code Behind the Movement

The heart of this project is the MovingPlatform class I created, which handles both linear movement and rotation of objects in the game world:

## The Movement System

The heart of this project is the MovingPlatform class I created, which handles both linear movement and rotation of objects in the game world. I learned how to use Unreal's property system to expose variables to the editor, allowing me to adjust movement speeds, distances, and rotation rates without modifying code.

This hands-on approach helped me understand how the Tick() function works with delta time to create smooth, frame-rate independent movementâ€”a concept that was initially challenging but became clearer through practical implementation.

## Acknowledgments

This project was built while following the "Unreal Engine 5 C++ Developer" course by GameDev.tv. Their step-by-step approach helped me transition from complete beginner in Game Development to writing functional C++ code in Unreal Engine.

I'm excited to continue building on these foundations as I progress in my game development journey!
